### Notes

Portify.JS has been confirmed to work in Chrome, Firefox, and IE (at on point). It should work on most browsers, but try chrome if its not working for you.

The Chrome version is more sophisticated and light weight. It will get your oauth token for you and will disable images and animations in the google music player before running.

The app runs real-time and takes around a second a song to go spotify -> google music. Google music -> spotify is faster.
